# GEFCom 2017

GEFCom 2017 modelling and forecasts.

__NOTE:__ This is the code I used for the competition when I was experimenting. As such it's not very clean and could definitely be tidied up.

Perhaps more useful is the tidy version of the data that I have stored over in the [camroach87/gefcom2017data](https://github.com/camroach87/gefcom2017data) repo. You can see what transformations I've applied to the original data in the `R` script there.

Code used to generate the paper related to this repo can be found in the [camroach87/1701-gefcom](https://github.com/camroach87/1701-gefcom).
