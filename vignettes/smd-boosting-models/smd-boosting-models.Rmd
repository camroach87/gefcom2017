# Introduction

This notebook explores fitting various models to produce quantile forecasts for the 2017 GEFCom-D competition.

Models will be fit using the `xgboost` package. Performance is assessed using time-series cross validation. The performance score is based on the pinball loss function.

## Data

Since this is for the GEFCom-D track of the competition only given data may be used. Hence, we will be able to use data for

* dates and times,
* holidays,
* dry bulb temperature,
* dew point temperature,
* demand.

Additionally, several dummy variables have been calculated. These include,

* month of year,
* season,
* holiday flag (boolean),
* day of week,
* weekend (boolean),
* dry bulb and dew point temperature differences.
